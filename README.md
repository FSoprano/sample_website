### Code samples:
Enclose code in backtick (accent grave) quotes:
I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.

For longer code samples, indent 4 characters

    This ought to look like
    a nice, juicy code sample.
