<h1>The Poems</h1>
  <p>
    William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consists of 154 poems, each fourteen
    lines long (three
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain">quatrains</a>
    followed by a rhyming
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet">couplet</a>).

    <h2>The perhaps most famous of them all</h2>

    <strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
   <p>
    Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
    Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br>
    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
    And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
   </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Shakespeare's life</h2>
  <p>
    Shakespeare's life was <em>extremely funny</em> even though he was born

   to respected parents. It soon became apparent that young William
   was a wordsmith manque. His father therefore sent him to a school for the
 <strong>linguistically gifted</strong>. There, little Bill was taught how to read and

write.

  The Shakespeare Foundation takes care of the great poet's heritage. It was founded
in 1813, shortly after the defeat of Napoleon and before the Congress of
Vienna.

  <p>
    This is not as important as it may seem.

  <h5>Even smaller headings suggest no importance at all.</h5>

    Big black hole.

  <h6>Headings at this size should not have been written at all</h6>

    Don't read this. It's not important!
